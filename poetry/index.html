When I was weak
I practiced for power, and was a fool

When I was powerful
I practiced for wisdom, and was unbalanced
When I was wise
I practice for Harmony, and am no more

When I am in Harmony
I don't practice at all

When I don't practice
Sometimes I become a fool
Sometimes I become weak
Sometimes I keep not being

Because I did not want to kill
I lied
I stole
I misconducted
I abused
And I died

Fortunately, I did not exist to be harmed
